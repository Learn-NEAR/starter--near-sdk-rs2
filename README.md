# `near-sdk-as` Starter Kit

This is a good project to use as a starting point for your AssemblyScript project.

## Samples

This repository includes a complete project structure for AssemblyScript contracts targeting the NEAR platform.

The example here is very basic.  It's a simple contract demonstrating the following concepts:
- a single contract
- the difference between `view` vs. `change` methods
- basic contract storage

There are 1 Rust contracts in this project, each in their own folder:

- **status message** in the `src/simple` folder

### Simple

We say that an rust contract is written in the "simple style" when the `index.ts` file (the contract entry point) includes a series of exported functions.

In this case, all exported functions become public contract methods.




## Usage

### Getting started

(see below for video recordings of each of the following steps)

INSTALL `NEAR CLI` first like this: `npm i -g near-cli`
INSTALL RUST toolchain

1. clone this repo to a local folder
2. run `./scripts/1.dev-deploy.sh`
3. run `./scripts/2.use-contract.sh`
4. run `./scripts/2.use-contract.sh` (yes, run it to see changes)
5. run `./scripts/3.cleanup.sh`

### Videos

**`1.dev-deploy.sh`**

This video shows the build and deployment of the contract.

**`2.use-contract.sh`**

This video shows contract methods being called.  You should run the script twice to see the effect it has on contract state.

**`3.cleanup.sh`**

This video shows the cleanup script running.  Make sure you add the `BENEFICIARY` environment variable. The script will remind you if you forget.

```sh
export BENEFICIARY=<your-account-here>   # this account receives contract account balance
```

  ```
  There are 2 "styles" of implementing AssemblyScript NEAR contracts:
  - the contract interface can either be a collection of exported functions
  - or the contract interface can be the methods of a an exported class

  We call the second style "Singleton" because there is only one instance of the class which is serialized to the blockchain storage.  Rust contracts written for NEAR do this by default with the contract struct.
